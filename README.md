# Bike Stores Sales Analysis
## Project Background
This project focuses on analyzing the sales data of Bike Stores, using transactional records from various store locations. The goal is to derive insights into customer purchasing behavior, revenue trends, product performance, and the effectiveness of sales representatives. By understanding these patterns, we can identify opportunities for improving sales strategies, optimizing inventory, and enhancing customer engagement.
## Executive Summary
The analysis is based on transactional data that includes customer details, product categories, revenue figures, and sales locations. This dataset has been visualized in a Tableau dashboard to uncover key insights regarding sales performance, customer preferences, and store profitability. The findings indicate that revenue generation is influenced by product category, store location, and the effectiveness of sales representatives. Additionally, sales trends show seasonal fluctuations, with peak periods and high-performing product categories driving overall revenue.

## Technical Project Information
The [original datset is available here](https://github.com/Debraj-Bora/Bike-Store-Sales-Analysis/blob/main/BikeStores.xlsx%20-%20Data.csv). I extracted and transformed data from multiple tables to create a final structured dataset for analysis. [You can view the SQL script here.](https://github.com/Debraj-Bora/Bike-Store-Sales-Analysis/blob/main/bike_store_sales.sql) It was then visualized in Tableau.
